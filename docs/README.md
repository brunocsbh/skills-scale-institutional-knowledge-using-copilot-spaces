# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of process guides provides a comprehensive framework for how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects, from initial idea through delivery and continuous improvement. Our approach is built on principles of customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

OctoAcme's project lifecycle follows a structured five-phase approach: **Initiation** validates business need and aligns stakeholders around measurable outcomes; **Planning** transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and release timelines; **Execution** manages day-to-day delivery through regular standups, PR workflows, and quality gates; **Release** deploys features to production with appropriate safeguards and rollback plans; and **Retrospective** captures learnings and drives continuous improvement. Throughout this lifecycle, clearly defined roles ensure accountability—Project Managers coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers define customer value and prioritize work, Developers implement solutions with quality and testability in mind, and QA/Testing validates acceptance criteria and quality standards.

Communication and risk management are woven throughout our processes. Teams maintain a regular cadence of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, using templates and single sources of truth to keep everyone aligned. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a Risk Register with clear ownership and mitigation plans, escalated through defined paths when blockers arise. Quality assurance is embedded at every stage—from unit and integration tests in CI pipelines to end-to-end smoke tests before release, security scanning, and manual QA for feature acceptance. This comprehensive approach ensures that OctoAcme delivers reliable, customer-focused solutions while maintaining transparency and enabling teams to learn and improve continuously.

Whether you're new to OctoAcme or looking for a refresher on specific processes, these guides provide the context and templates you need to collaborate effectively and deliver high-quality results.
